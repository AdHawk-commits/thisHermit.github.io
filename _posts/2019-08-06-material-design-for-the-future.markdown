So, I was looking for good color palettes online and found
this article from [material.io](https://material.io) and found cool
looking color palettes to choose from.

So, for mobile, the blog will have a bottom bar with a right rounded
square which will allow to add comments.

Rest all will be similar to this image [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host/mio-staging%2Fmio-design%2F1563837804615%2Fassets%2F1MNcDnSDUfF30L2jqzYQEj4hLzDnMe2xP%2Fdarktheme-elevationdiagram.png)
.

The color palette is Blue Gray 50 from material.io's [dark theme](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors).

For PC, the navigation will be quite simple with a burger on the top
right.

All the comments for this blog will be powered by disqus. I have found
it quite a lot of times on the internet and have found quite a lot of
interesting discussions on them.

Also, creating an email subscription would make more sense to notify
users of the latest posts.

And for the most controversial decision yet, I am planning to add
Google Ads and Google Analytics too. Let's hope people take it well.
