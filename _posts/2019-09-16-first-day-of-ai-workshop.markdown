Today some AI Workshop started in our college, which make a lot of our subject teachers busy. This caused us to have a class with a senior faculty of ours, Dr. Nagesh Bhattu. He taught us about semaphores (couldn't actually understand what it meant though) and something about a rendezvous semaphore.

After our break, we had to empty classes, with no teachers; the first time that this actually happened in our semester. Read the Chapter Threads from our OS book by Abraham Silberschatz. Quite a small chapter to be honest.

Got a surprise when we learnt that our DWDM ma'am actually wants us to mug up the code for some excercises in JAVA for the mid sem exams. That seems very unreasonable to me tbh.

Planning to make the complete design for the E Beats Project that my team got from Andhra Police by tomorrow. Also I would set up the Github repository shorty after that so that I can create appropriate issues corresponding to various user stories. Would be assigning each team member on each Activity of the App so that the work load is balanced. Maybe its the right time to look at the project tab in github and play around with it.

Would be reading Ian Sommerville's Software Engineering book today and continuing on with my time table for the skills. Would try to finish greg shorthand quickly to save time.
