The world is now a positive sum game and now the more you make your neighbor happy, the more happy you going to be consequtively. Cover of this [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvskMHn0sqQ).

People think the world to be a zero sum game. In simple words if you want more food, you had to take it from some other person's plate. Or as the old saying goes that there is a single sack of rice and because of the increase in population there are a lot many people who want to eat it.

So, everyone know about Supply and Demand.

Supply means the ability of anything to give something in return continuously.
Demand means the ability of people to consume products continuously.

Supply increase when more people have the freedom and education to contribute. They become inventors, researchers, engineers or thinkers.
Demand increase as people get richer and can pay for new services for new solutions.

This in turn provides the profit for the people in supply to do their job better. So, naturally if many people want and can pay for something, it will get the innovators attention and energy.

So, in even more simpler words, by increasing the living standards of the people around us, we increase the demand for ideas and at the same time making the supply of the ideas easy.

I would like to point you out, and recommend that don't be a selfish person by hiding awesome resources for yourself (or any other activity that supports the interests of a single person or group, instead of the whole world). If you think you can gain more by keeping things secret, scared that your close ones could get a better piece of the money pile if you keep it for yourself, think again. You are deeply contradicting yourself.

If you are like this, there is no shame in admitting it. But if you continue to do so after knowing the facts, you are just slowing down the progress of humankind. You are responsible for much of the worse things that our soceity is producing everyday.
