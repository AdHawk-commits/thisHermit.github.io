For a very long while I was floating-dust. Floating about on this Earth for a long while, which was broken from a rock. The rock in turn was solidified long ago from magma, which in turn came from the bowels of Earth. This magma was too formed long ago when the Earth was spinning, munching all the rocks around it.

These rocks were dust before for a very long time which collapsed under its own gravity floating in space. This dust came from the ashes of stars. Some parts from their fiery death or maybe through their gradual fading.

This floating-dust wandered about the Earth. Until one day God decided that this dust was to be given life. So my particles were arranged from the farthest portion on this planet and was given a conscience.

This is how I came into existence. Some lifeless dust given life and a conscience. Nothing more, nothing less.
