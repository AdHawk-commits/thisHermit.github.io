started the youtube playlist

and installing the basic jekyll and bundler library through an error. Yay!
started reinstalling ruby it but got an upgrade for my linux distro
after about half an hour or so done!

coming back to installing ruby, this time doing it manually from their
git repo instead of relying on my package manager.

installed rbenv (a ruby environment like venv for python).

installed ruby 2.6.3 (the latest one) and then made it globally available
