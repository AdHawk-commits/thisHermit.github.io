## Git-Mania
Started git today from [over here](https://githowto.com/) and started revising
its contents made a lot of shortcuts too like
```
  ci <==> commit
  co <==> checkout
  st <==> status
```
and so on.

so started postman today-

learnt about making get and post requests with postman
also learnt about making modification to headers of these two requests.
On top of that, learnt to make tests for various conditions and how to
iterate the tests for a number of times.
